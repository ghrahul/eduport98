# eduport

The website initially will have different course options mainly computer science courses, every topic will have an attached pdf notes and a lecture video.
A user can register themselves either a professor or as a student. The professor will be expected to provide lectures and notes while the student benefits from it.
The idea is to make this the Facebook of education portals to connect students with field specialist professors as a result of which students can get over with their weaknesses.
The primary purpose is to fill in the void in the education system by reducing the communication gap between faculties and students to almost null.
